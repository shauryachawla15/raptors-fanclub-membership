# Data File Handling Project in Python  

This is a mini-project that demonstrates file handling in Python using a fun scenario:  
managing the membership register of a university Raptors fan club.  

## 📌 Project Description  
Every month, the fan club updates its member register by removing inactive members.  
Your task (simulated in this project) is to:  
- Keep only active members in the current members file.  
- Move inactive members into a separate file of ex-members.  
- Preserve the original format, including headers.  

This project was adapted from a Coursera exercise.  

## ⚙️ Features  
- Generates sample membership files with random data.  
- Reads and separates **active** vs **inactive** members.  
- Writes back only active members to `members.txt`.  
- Appends inactive members to `inactive.txt`.  
- Includes a **test case** to validate correctness.
